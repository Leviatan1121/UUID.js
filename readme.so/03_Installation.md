## Installation
Installing the UUID generator in your application is as simple as it should be.

Depending on what you work with or what you need, we have different installation methods.

```javascript
const UUID = require('https://uuid.levihub.dev/uuid.js');
```

#### Using import and export

```javascript
import UUID from 'https://uuid.levihub.dev/uuid_module.js';
```

#### Using it as an inline script
